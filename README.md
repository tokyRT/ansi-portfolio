# ANSI Portfolio

This is an ongoing experiment where I am trying to render my portfolio in the terminal using ANSI escape codes.
So instead of visting [ansi.toky-rt.dev](ansi.toky-rt.dev) via a web browser, you can view it in your terminal with a curl command.

```bash
curl ansi.toky-rt.dev 
```
## Yes, but why?
It's just fun to code it xD

I saw ysap.sh doing the same and I thought it was a cool idea to have a portfolio in the terminal.
